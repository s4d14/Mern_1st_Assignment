      <p>
        Delmonico steak, thick steak prepared in a style made famous in the
        mid-19th century by Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City, which is
        cited as the first (1827) official “restaurant” in the United States
        where individuals ordered off a menu instead of getting only what was
        prepared that day. Delmonico style refers to rib cuts, but the cuts of
        meat that the restaurant used for the first Delmonico steaks remain up
        for debate. Not infrequently, the steak may be two or more inches thick.
        Regardless of cut, Delmonico steak traditionally is prepared with salt
        and pepper, basted with butter, broiled to order, and topped with herbed
        butter. It was commonly served with “Delmonico potatoes” (a baked and
        slightly mashed potato dish topped with cheese).
